---System Info---
Endeavour OS on Framework latptop

---Issue---------
Running "Virtual Machine Manager" app gave error about QEMU not being
operational, regarding some socket not existing.
No virtualization services (LXC or QEMU/KVM) were operational, and no
virtual machines appeared.

---Solution------
Use specific commands to start and enable libvirtd
  sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
  sudo systemctl start libvirtd
then launch virt-manager as app (there's also a way to set this up
automatically, but right now it's more trouble than it's worth)
