---Issue---------
Plugging/unplugging headphone seemed to mix mute settings.
For example, if audio was playing through speakers at level X,
system was muted, headphones were plugged in (giving audio out from
them), then headphones were unplugged, the system would not stay muted
(the previous speaker setting) but instead would play at level X.

---Solution------
Correctly bind "mute key" in i3 configuration file.

Binding was
    bindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer sset Master toggle && killall -USR1 i3blocks
which did not interface with Pulse, when it should have been
    bindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer -D pulse sset Master toggle && killall -USR1 i3blocks
which let's Pulse keep track of the two separately (just my understanding).
