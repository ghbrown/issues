---System Info---
Android
Moto G Power cell phone

---Issue---------
Attempting to use SSO at new institution opened a link to my old
institution. Since only SSO was permitted, I was unable to sign into
Zoom at the new institution.

---Solution------
The Zoom app itself had cached data about what institution I was at
and would use this cached data to open the SSO of the old institution.
To fix this delete cache and storage of Zoom app on Android
(Settings -> Apps -> Zoom)
