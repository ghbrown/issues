---System Info---
EndeavourOS on Framework Laptop

---Issue---------
setting up hibernation is extremely difficult

---Solution------

**GENERAL TIPS**
- the ArchWiki is generally very complete, but assumes a high level of
  knowledge, doing very little handholding when it comes to adding
  kernel parameters and regenerating mkinitcpio and grub
- checking journalctl can be very useful when diagnosing why
  hibernate isn't working as intended
- even when hibernate works, it will look like the laptop is booting,
  splash screen, choose image, etc. but will then immediately
  recover the hibernated state

**SWAP FILE**
set up swap file in /home using this guide:
  https://linuxize.com/post/create-a-linux-swap-file/

a very useful command for checking if /etc/fstab has errors is
  sudo findmnt --verify --verbose

enable systemd to read from /home on login (not default behavior):
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate
  https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/15354
  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=259382

**GRUB AND OTHER EARLY BOOT STUFF**
add "resume" to mkinitcpio and configure kernel parameters related to
swap file:
  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xek3TGKzLWw

mkinitcpio can be regenerated with:
  sudo mkinitcpio -p linux

get the UUID of the partition CONTAINING the swap file with:
  sudo findmnt -no UUID -T <path to swap file>
