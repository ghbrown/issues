---System Info---
openSUSE Leap 15 server

---Issue---------
attempting to login to server over SSH (when on same local network)
failed when server had not yet logged into user account

---Solution------
Server was not connecting to network before login, needed to
enable wifi network to be accessible to "all users" on server, so it
would connect to network before user login.
