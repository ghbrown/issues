EndeavourOS

Framework Laptop

---Issue---------
Attempting to create a lock+suspend entry in the rofi power menu.
Change the command of the "Suspend" entry to
"<any lock command>; systemctl suspend"
but when that entry was selected, the system would only ever lock.

---Solution------
Tried
"<any lock command> && systemctl suspend"
instead, which worked.
TODO: if the ; version worked, then the && version should also work,
      since the && does the same thing but takes the extra precaution
      of checking exit flags according to bash syntax
