EndeavourOS
Framework Laptop

---Issue---------
None of the colors entered in .config/termite/config
seemed to affect the actual colors shown in terminal

---Solution------
I only entered color 0 through 6, deleting the rest up to 14.
These 7-14 colors were actually critical for common file types like
directories etc., so it used default colors for these file types.
Added back those colors and set them appropriately.
