---System Info---
EndeavourOS
i3
Thunar File Manager


---Issue---------
Attempting to right click then "open file in terminal" gave an
error like "fallback terminal emulator not found"

---Solution------
Thunar allows configuration of custom right click options, in this
case I replaced the "exo-open ...." associated with the "Open in
Terminal" option to "termite".
