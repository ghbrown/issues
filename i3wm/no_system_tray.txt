---Issue---
System tray (spot to show some active app icons like Discord,
Flameshot, etc.) did not appear in i3bar.


---Solution---
I had been messing with xrandr, and tried to set things back with
$ xrandr --auto
However, the solution (on my Framework laptop) was
$ xrandr --output eDP1 --primary
they key party being the primary flag.
